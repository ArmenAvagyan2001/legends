        "name": "Leo Messi",
        "FullName": "Lionel Andrés Messi",
        "biography": <>
            <p>
                Lionel Messi, in full Lionel Andrés Messi, also called Leo Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Argentina),    
                Argentine-born football (soccer) player who was named Fédération Internationale de Football Association 
                (FIFA) world player of the year six times (2009–12, 2015, and 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based 
                top-division football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides 
                of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona’s 
                under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level 
                teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the 
                country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), 
                he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, 
                Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish 
                citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. The next year Messi 
                and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
            </p>
            <p>
                Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, 
                finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year. In early 
                2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three 
                major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), 
                and the Champions League title. He scored 38 goals in 51 matches during that season, and he bested Ronaldo in the balloting
                for FIFA World Player of the Year honours by a record margin. During the 2009–10 season Messi scored 34 goals in domestic 
                games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, and he was 
                named the 2010 world player of the year (the award was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or that year).
            </p>
            <p>
                Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles the following season, which helped him capture an unprecedented 
                third consecutive world player of the year award. In March 2012 he netted his 233rd goal for Barcelona, becoming the club’s 
                all-time leading scorer in La Liga play when only 24 years old. He finished Barcelona’s 2011–12 season (which included another 
                Copa del Rey win) with 73 goals in all competitions, breaking Gerd Müller’s 39-year-old record for single-season goals in a major 
                European football league. His landmark season led to his being named the 2012 world player of the year, which made Messi the 
                first player to win the honour four times. His 46 La Liga goals in 2012–13 led the league, and Barcelona captured another 
                domestic top-division championship that season. In 2014 he set the overall Barcelona goal record when he scored his 370th 
                goal as a member of the team. That same year he also broke the career scoring records for play in both the Champions League 
                (with 72 goals) and La Liga (with 253 goals).
            </p>
            <p>
                Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course 
                of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour. He scored 41 goals across all competitions for 
                Barcelona in 2015–16, and the club won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey during that season. Messi topped that with 53 goals 
                for Barcelona in 2016–17, leading the team to another Copa del Rey title. In 2017–18 he scored 45 goals, and Barcelona won the La 
                Liga–Copa del Rey double once again. Messi scored 51 goals across all domestic competitions in 2018–19 as Barcelona won another La 
                Liga championship. In December 2019 he won his sixth career Ballon d’Or. In the 2020–21 season, Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey 
                title, the seventh of Messi’s career. He became a free agent in 2021, and financial issues—some of which were the result of La 
                Liga rules—largely prevented him from re-signing with Barcelona. He left the club having set a number of records; notably, he was 
                the leading goal scorer in the league’s history (474). Later in 2021 he signed with Paris St.-Germain.

        "date": "5 February 1992",
        "name": "Neymar jr.",
        "FullName": "Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr.",
        "biography": <>
            <p>
                <strong>Neymar</strong>, in full <strong>Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr.</strong> , (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil), Brazilian football 
                (soccer) player who was one of the most prolific scorers in his country’s storied football history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a former professional footballer
                who remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son’s career. Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, 
                Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista’s youth team in São Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, 
                who was already an impressive player, joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the same club for which Brazilian football 
                legend Pelé starred over the majority of his domestic career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with Spain’s Real Madrid, 
                and Santos had to increase its spending to retain him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the field, with excellent body control, 
                quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team debut with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged 
                a goal every other match and helped the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club competition) 
                in 2011. Neymar’s many individual honours with Santos included the South American Footballer of the Year title in 2011 and 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                In June 2013 Neymar signed a five-year contract with FC Barcelona after a trade with Santos in exchange for €57 million (about $76 million), 
                one of the most expensive soccer transfers in history. Two years later he helped Barcelona capture the “treble” of a La Liga championship, 
                a Copa del Rey title, and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League title. While Neymar was instrumental in Barcelona’s 
                success from 2013 to 2017, totaling 105 goals in 186 games with the club across all competitions, he longed to get out of the shadow of teammate 
                Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in football history. As a result, in August 2017 he engineered a departure to the French club Paris 
                Saint-Germain (PSG) for a then record €222 million ($263 million) transfer fee. In addition to being the new face of PSG, Neymar also became 
                the highest-paid player in the world, with a €45 million ($53 million) annual salary. He appeared in just 30 matches during his first season 
                with PSG, scoring 28 goals for the club before breaking a bone in his right foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internationally, Neymar was considered for the Brazilian side that participated in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but he was ultimately not 
                included on the squad. Instead, he made his debut for the national team in August 2010, in a friendly match against the U.S., where he scored his 
                first international goal in Brazil’s 2–0 win. He scored four goals for Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup, including one in the team’s 3–0 victory 
                over Spain in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament’s most valuable player as well as the Bronze Boot as its third highest scorer. 
                Neymar starred for Brazil when his home country hosted the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals in five games before he was knocked out of the competition 
                with a fractured vertebra in the quarterfinals. Without the team’s most important player, Brazil lost by a shocking 7–1 margin to eventual-champion Germany 
                in the semifinals. Despite his early exit from the tournament, Neymar won the Bronze Boot. At the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, he led the 
                Brazilian men’s side to its first Olympic gold medal, scoring the winning penalty in extra time of the final match against Germany. He scored 
                two goals at the 2018 World Cup but was as well-known for his many theatrical embellishments of fouls during that tournament (Neymar was the 
                most-fouled player in the event) as for his on-field play. Brazil’s World Cup appearance ended with a quarterfinal loss to Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Off field, Neymar experienced legal troubles. In 2012 a Brazilian court ordered him and his father to pay substantial back taxes from 2007 to 2008. 
                An appeal was denied in 2016, and that year a Brazilian court additionally found Neymar guilty of having falsified documents in order to avoid paying 
                taxes on income received in 2011–13. The player and his father were also called into Spanish court after an investment fund that had sponsored him 
                alleged that it had been defrauded during his 2013 transfer to Barcelona.

        "date": "25 January 1980",
        "name": "Xavi",
        "FullName": "Xavier Hernández Creus",
        "biography": <>
            <p>
                Xavi, byname of Xavier Hernández Creus, (born January 25, 1980, Terrassa, Spain), Spanish football (soccer) player and 
                manager who was widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world in the early 21st century.
            </p>
            <p>
                At age 11 Xavi joined the youth squad of FC Barcelona, a first-division football club near his hometown. He advanced 
                through the club’s various junior ranks before making his first-team debut in 1998. In his first season with the team, 
                Barcelona won the 1998–99 La Liga—Spain’s top football league—championship. Xavi’s playing time steadily increased 
                over the following seasons, and he was a key member of the club when it won the 2004–05 La Liga title. Xavi and 
                Barcelona successfully defended the La Liga championship in 2005–06 and captured the Champions League title that 
                season as well. The team bested this accomplishment in 2008–09 as it won the first “treble” (winning three major 
                European club titles in one season) in Barcelona history—taking the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major 
                domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Xavi helped Barcelona to additional La Liga titles in 2010–11 and 
                2012–13 as well as a Copa del Rey victory in 2011–12. In March 2015 he announced that he was leaving Barcelona 
                for Qatar’s Al-Sadd at the end of the 2014–15 season. He finished his storied Barcelona career on a high note as 
                the club won another treble that season. He retired from club play in May 2019 and was named the manager of Al-
                Sadd soon thereafter. In 2021 he returned to Barcelona to manage his former club.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 metres) tall, Xavi made up for his short stature with an unparalleled field vision, 
                superb ball-handling skills, and the ability to make crisp, precise passes. More of a playmaker than a prolific 
                scorer, Xavi led La Liga in assists in both 2008–09 and 2009–10.
            </p>
            <p>
                In international play, Xavi was the captain of the Spanish under-20 team that won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 
                1999. Shortly after helping Spain to a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, he was promoted to the Spanish 
                senior team. Xavi played sparingly at the 2002 World Cup and did not get off the bench at the 2004 European Championship 
                (Euro 2004). He was a regular in the Spanish lineup by the time the team played in the 2006 World Cup, but he had his 
                first notable international success at Euro 2008. There he led Spain to its first major international title in 44 
                years and was named Player of the Tournament after skillfully orchestrating the Spanish offense throughout the event. 
                The team’s success continued at the 2010 World Cup, where Xavi helped Spain win the first World Cup championship in 
                the country’s history. In 2012 Spain captured another Euro title, which made the team the first national squad to 
                win three consecutive major world championships and led many observers to argue that Xavi’s club was the greatest 
                national team in football history. An aging Spanish team could not continue its dominance at the 2014 World Cup, 
                however, where the squad was handily beaten in its first two games and was eliminated from the tournament, and soon 
                afterward Xavi retired from international football.

        "date": "13 April 1978",
        "name": "Puyol",
        "FullName": "Carles Puyol Saforcada",
        "biography": `Carles Puyol Saforcada is a Spanish former professional footballer who played his entire .career for Barcelona He mainly played as a central defender, but he could also play in either full-back position, mostly as a right-back. Praised for his defensive qualities and leadership, he is widely regarded as one of the best defenders and captains in the history of the sport.He was Barcelona's captain from August 2004 until his retirement in 2014, and appeared in 593 competitive matches for the club. He won 18 major club titles, including six La Liga trophies and three Champions Leagues.Born in La Pobla de Segur, Lleida, Catalonia, Puyol started playing football for his hometown club as a goalkeeper, but after injury problems with his shoulder he switched to forward. He said that in his youth, "My parents were skeptical about me becoming a footballer and encouraged me to study." In 1995, he joined FC Barcelona's youth system at La Masia, switching positions again, to play as a defensive midfielder; two years later, he started playing for the club's B-team, occupying the position of right-back.In 1998, Barcelona accepted an offer from Málaga to sell Puyol, who was behind Frank de Boer and Michael Reiziger in the pecking order. However, he refused to leave after seeing his best friend Xavi make his first-team debut.Louis van Gaal promoted Puyol to the first team the following year, and he made his La Liga debut on 2 October 1999 in a 2–0 away win against Real Valladolid. After that he successfully made another conversion, to central defender. During the 2003 off-season, as Barcelona was immersed in a financial crisis, Manchester United showed interest in signing Puyol, but no move ever materialised. Two years later, he extended his contract for a further five seasons.Puyol was named club captain at the end of 2003–04, after the retirement of Luis Enrique. He continued to be a defensive cornerstone for Barça, being awarded the "Best European right-back" award by UEFA in 2002 (amongst other individual accolades), and helped the Catalans win two consecutive league titles. In 2005–06 he appeared in a total of 52 games, including 12 in that season's UEFA Champions League which ended in victory against Arsenal, the club's second European Cup.On 16 September 2008, Puyol made his 400th appearance for Barcelona in a Champions League group stage match against Sporting CP. In the league season, despite injury problems, he appeared in 28 matches and helped them win another league title. His only goal came against Real Madrid in El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu on 2 May 2009 which finished with a resounding 6–2 win, and he celebrated his goal by kissing his Catalan flag armband in front of the incensed Madrid fans. He was essential to the team also winning the 2009 Copa del Rey, the 2009 Champions League, the 2009 UEFA Super Cup and the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup to complete an unprecedented sextuple, appearing in nearly 100 official matches.On 13 November 2010, Puyol played his 500th game in all competitions for Barcelona in a domestic league match against Villareal. He struggled again with injuries during the 2010–11 campaign, but still appeared in 28 matches, again winning the league and the Champions League. He played the final six minutes in the Champions League final, a 3–1 victory over Manchester United at the Wembley Stadium.Barcelona bid farewell to Puyol on 15 May 2014, after a fifteen-year career in the first team (ten as captain) that brought him 21 titles. At a packed Auditori 1899, his teammates, ex-teammates, presidents and coaches paid tribute to him, and he said "I’ve lived the dream of so many young kids, doing what I most enjoy in life, playing football and training". He announced his retirement shortly after at the age of 36 but stayed with his only club; he was immediately appointed director of football Andoni Zubizarreta's assistant. He resigned in January 2015, shortly after Zubizarreta was fired.`,

        "date":"April 25, 1947",
        "name": "Johan Cruyff",
        "FullName": "Hendrik Johannes Cruijff",
        "biography": <>
            <p>
                Johan Cruyff, byname of Hendrik Johannes Cruijff, (born April 25, 1947, Amsterdam, Netherlands—died March 24, 
                2016, Barcelona, Spain), Dutch football (soccer) forward renowned for his imaginative playmaking. He won numerous 
                honours, including European Footballer of the Year (1971, 1973, and 1974).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cruyff joined the youth development squad of Amsterdam’s Ajax soccer club when he was 10 years old. He was 17 when 
                he made his debut with the senior team. After helping Ajax win six league titles, four national cups, and three European 
                Champion Clubs’ Cups (now known as the UEFA [Union of European Football Associations] Champions League), he was 
                transferred to FC Barcelona in 1973. Captained by Cruyff, Barcelona won the Spanish League championship in 1974 and was 
                runner-up in 1976 and 1977.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temperamental Cruyff, along with Franz Beckenbauer of West Germany, was regarded as the world’s finest player in an 
                era when the European game was dominated by “total football,” a style of play developed by Dutch coach Rinus Michels that 
                emphasized all-around skill, versatility, and creativity. Cruyff debuted with the Dutch national team when he was 19 and 
                went on to score 33 goals in 48 international matches. In the 1974 World Cup tournament, the Dutch team, led by Cruyff and 
                including Johan Neeskens and Ruud Krol, put on a memorable display of total football that earned them the nickname 
                “Clockwork Orange” (a name borrowed from the novel but inspired by the team’s orange jerseys). Although the Netherlands 
                lost to West Germany in the championship match, Cruyff’s individual brilliance won him the tournament’s Golden Ball 
                (Most Valuable Player) award.

                From 1979 to 1980 Cruyff played with several American teams, including the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Washington Diplomats, 
                and he was named the North American Soccer League’s Most Valuable Player in 1979. He returned to Ajax in 1981, but two years 
                later he joined rival team Feyenoord after a contract dispute. There he won his ninth Dutch championship and fifth national 
                cup. After retiring as a player in 1984, Cruyff coached both Ajax (1987) and Barcelona (1989) to the European Cup Winners’ 
                Cup. In 1992 he guided Barcelona to both the European Champion Clubs’ Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, but he was fired in 1996. 
                He returned to the sidelines in 2009 to manage the Catalonian national team, a position he held until 2013.

                Cruyff was also involved in philanthropy. He founded both a nonprofit organization to encourage children to participate in sports 
                and the Johan Cruyff Institute, which provides an education in sports management.
